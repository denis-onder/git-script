# Git Commit/Push script

It gets fu\*\*ing annoying to do `git add . && git commit -m 'message' && git push origin whatever-branch` a gazillion times a day.

### Usage:

- Install the script by running `./install.sh` from the root directory of this project.
- Within the project you are working on, just run `gitScript`
